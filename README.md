## Day 11 Capstone Project - 100 Days of Python 
### Blackjack (VS Computer)

This is a simplified (no UI) version of Blackjack made in Python. It was made as my capstone project for the 11th day of the 100 days of Python course I am taking in mid-2023. Complex validation is kept at a minimum to stay in line with the course. 

Things to note include that this is only one player versus the computer, which will be the dealer. Also, the card deck is assumed to be infinite in this instance. Aces will count as an 11 if they do NOT cause a bust, and a 1 otherwise.
